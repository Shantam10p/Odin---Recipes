  <h2>Desription</h2>
  <p>Lasagna is a hearty and comforting Italian dish made up of layers of wide, flat pasta sheets alternated with rich, savory fillings. A traditional lasagna typically features layers of tender lasagna noodles, a meaty tomato-based sauce infused with garlic, onions, and herbs, and a creamy cheese filling made from ricotta, mozzarella, and Parmesan. These layers are stacked together to form a flavorful and filling casserole that’s topped with a golden, bubbling layer of melted cheese. After baking, the lasagna becomes soft, with the sauce soaking into the noodles and the cheese creating a perfect, gooey texture. Each bite offers a delicious balance of savory meat, tangy tomato sauce, and creamy, melted cheese. Lasagna is a classic comfort food, perfect for family gatherings or cozy meals.</p>
