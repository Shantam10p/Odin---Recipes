  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Pizza is a popular Italian dish consisting of a yeasted flatbread typically topped with tomato sauce, cheese, and various other ingredients such as meats, vegetables, and herbs. The base is crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, while the toppings are perfectly melted and flavorful. It can be baked in a wood-fired oven for an authentic taste or a conventional oven at home for an equally delightful treat. Pizza can be customized in countless ways, making it a versatile dish loved around the world.</p>
  
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>2 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 tsp sugar</li>
    <li>1 packet (2 ¼ tsp) active dry yeast</li>
    <li>1 tsp salt</li>
    <li>1 cup warm water (110°F)</li>
    <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
    <li>½ cup tomato sauce</li>
    <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    <li>Toppings of your choice (pepperoni, mushrooms, onions, bell peppers, olives, etc.)</li>
    <li>Fresh basil or dried oregano for garnish (optional)</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>In a small bowl, combine warm water, sugar, and yeast. Let it sit for about 5 minutes until the yeast becomes frothy.</li>
    <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine flour and salt. Add the yeast mixture and olive oil. Stir until a dough forms.</li>
    <li>Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 5-7 minutes until smooth and elastic.</li>
    <li>Place the dough in an oiled bowl, cover it with a clean towel, and let it rise in a warm place for 1-1.5 hours, or until it doubles in size.</li>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 475°F (245°C).</li>
    <li>Punch down the dough and roll it out on a floured surface to your desired thickness.</li>
    <li>Place the rolled dough onto a pizza stone or baking sheet lined with parchment paper.</li>
    <li>Spread the tomato sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border for the crust.</li>
    <li>Sprinkle shredded mozzarella cheese on top of the sauce, followed by your choice of toppings.</li>
    <li>Bake the pizza in the preheated oven for 12-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly and melted.</li>
    <li>Remove the pizza from the oven and garnish with fresh basil or dried oregano, if desired. Slice and serve hot.</li>
