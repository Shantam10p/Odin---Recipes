  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Momo is a traditional Nepali dumpling filled with either minced meat or vegetables, wrapped in dough, and steamed or fried. The filling is usually spiced with ginger, garlic, onion, and other flavorful ingredients. These juicy and tender dumplings are typically served with a spicy tomato-based dipping sauce, making them an irresistible snack or meal. Momo can be steamed for a healthier version or pan-fried for a crispy exterior. Itâ€™s a beloved comfort food, enjoyed in Nepal and across South Asia.</p>
  
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>500g ground chicken, pork, or beef (or a mix)</li>
    <li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
    <li>2-3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>1-inch piece of ginger, minced</li>
    <li>1 tsp ground cumin</li>
    <li>1 tsp ground coriander</li>
    <li>1 tsp garam masala</li>
    <li>1 tbsp soy sauce</li>
    <li>1 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
    <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    <li>1 pack of wonton or dumpling wrappers (or homemade dough)</li>
    <li>Chopped fresh cilantro (optional)</li>
    <li>Water for sealing the wrappers</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>In a large bowl, combine the ground meat, chopped onion, garlic, ginger, cumin, coriander, garam masala, soy sauce, vegetable oil, salt, and pepper. Mix well until fully combined.</li>
    <li>Take one dumpling wrapper and place about 1 tablespoon of the meat filling in the center.</li>
    <li>Wet the edges of the wrapper with a little water and fold the wrapper over the filling to form a half-moon shape. Pinch the edges together to seal. Repeat with the remaining wrappers and filling.</li>
    <li>To steam the momos, place them in a steamer basket lined with parchment paper, making sure they don't touch each other.</li>
    <li>Steam the momos for 10-12 minutes until the filling is fully cooked and the wrappers are translucent.</li>
    <li>If you prefer fried momos, heat a little oil in a pan and pan-fry the steamed momos for a crispy exterior.</li>
    <li>Serve the momos hot with a spicy tomato dipping sauce or achar.</li>
  </ol>
